# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab: Network & Log Analysis in Linux

## 📋 Overview
This project documents my hands-on training as a **SOC Analyst**, focusing on attack surface monitoring and intrusion detection using Linux environments (Google Cloud Shell).

## 🔍 Exercise 1: Port & Service Auditing (Attack Surface)
As a first step in a security audit, I identified the services "listening" for external connections to map the potential attack surface.

**Command executed:**
`ss -tulpn`

### Technical Analysis:
| Column | Technical Meaning | Observation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Address** | IP and Port where the service is listening. | Identified ports on `0.0.0.0` (open to the world). |
| **Peer Address** | Remote address of the connecting client. | Value `*:*` indicates the port is in `LISTEN` state (idle). |
| **State: LISTEN** | The port is open and available. | Port **22 (SSH)** was found active. |

**Security Finding:** High ports (e.g., 8998, 38465) were detected on `127.0.0.1`. Since they are bound to *localhost*, these services are not visible from the internet, complying with system hardening best practices.

## 🕵️ Exercise 2: Brute Force Detection (Log Forensics)
I simulated a scenario where a server receives multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful one.

**IP Filtering One-Liner:**
```bash
grep "401" access_log.txt | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
### 🕵️ Incident Investigation: Brute Force Detection
In this scenario, I analyzed a web server log to identify suspicious patterns. By correlating failed login attempts with a final successful entry, I identified a successful **Brute Force Attack**.

#### Forensic Findings:
* **Identification:** TheIP `192.168.1.10` generated multiple **401 (Unauthorized)** status codes in a short period, indicating an automated attempt to guess credentials.
* **Intrusion Confirmation:** After filtering for the **200 (OK)** status code, I confirmed that the same attacker IP gained successful access only seconds after the failed attempts.
* **Time Correlation:** The transition from `401` to `200` within a 20-second window confirms the breach.

> **Action Taken:** In a real-world SOC environment, this would trigger an immediate **Incident Response** protocol: isolating the affected account, blocking the source IP via Firewall, and forced credential reset.
