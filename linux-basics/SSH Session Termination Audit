## 🛡️ Exercise: SSH Session Termination Audit
Monitoring when and where sessions are closed is critical for identifying session hijacking or automated malicious activity.

**Command executed:**
```bash
grep "closed by" /var/log/auth.log | awk -F" " '{print "Access Date:" $1 "| Host:", $2}'

I transformed the raw system logs into a structured format for better readability:

Log Output	Analysis
Access Date: 2026-02-18T18:08:24...	Precise timestamp of the session termination.
Host: cs-11673031153-default	Identification of the specific asset (Google Cloud Shell instance).

## 🛠️ Tool Comparison: AWK vs. CUT
In this section, I explore the differences between `awk` and `cut` for forensic data extraction.

### Case 1: Formatted Reporting (AWK)
When I need to create a human-readable report with custom labels, `awk` is the best choice.
**Command:**
`grep "closed by" /var/log/auth.log | awk -F" " '{print "Access Date:" $1 "| Host:", $2}'`

### Case 2: High-Speed Precision Extraction (CUT)
When I only need raw data without extra text, `cut` is more efficient. Here I use a "Double Cut" to isolate the Year and Month from the timestamp.

**Command:**
```bash
grep "closed by" /var/log/auth.log | cut -d " " -f 1 | cut -d "-" -f 1,2

Feature	              AWK	                   CUT
Output Style	Access Date: 2026-02-18...	   2026-02
Labels	      Can add custom text/labels	   Raw data only
Complexity	  High (Powerful script engine)	 Low (Fast stream editor)

I prefer awk for final security reports and cut for quick scripts or when I need to chain multiple filters to clean specific data points like IPs or dates.
